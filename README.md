# Predicted Runway In-Use Deployment

This repository contains deployment artifacts for the Predicted Runway In-Use project.

## Use

You can deploy the docker containers with:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The web-app service expects in `./predicted_runway/models` the trained sklearn models you wish to make available as it will use this directory as a bind mount.

The nginx services expects in `./nginx/secrets` the following files:

- A file `selfsigned-cert.pem` with the public key to be used for TLS termination.
- A file `selfsigned-key.pem`with the private key to be used for TLS termination.
- A file `dhparams.pem` with the Diffie-Hellman parameters.
